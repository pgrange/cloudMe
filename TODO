... vmmanage - display a warning before running a template, in case some VM are based on it.
vvv bug - vmtemplate - include a trap to cleanup when ^C hit while downloading (https://github.com/n0vember/nocloud/issues/16)
... security - secure spice connections
... templates - being able to base templates on templates
... templates - modify debian8 template to install libpam-systemd
... network - machines should have a fqdn different from hostname (i.e. have a nocloud domain for instance)
>>> network - make as much as possible for host to use dnsmasq as a resolver
... installation - commit group service feature
... installation - create systemv services for those who refuse systemd
... installation - allow the use of spicec instead of spicy (for installation on debian) or set spicy as optionnal dependency
... installation - verify gl capability before using

RELEASE 2.1

... templates - create VMs on host, no download (http://ask.xmodulo.com/mount-qcow2-disk-image-linux.html)

RELEASE 2.0

xxx make uninstall
... systemv services
>>> core - use environment variable to restrict to a group
   vvv make group option available in vminventory
   vvv rename the concept of group as context. All references across scripts must be uniform
   vvv make type the only name across scripts for type and subgroup
   vvv adapt scripts to take NC_CONTEXT variable as context if none specified, default context is then named default
   vvv make scripts options as uniform as possible - no overlap between major options (-c -t -h -v ...)
   ... abandon getopts ? find a way to have long options
vvv vmrun - make -b default behaviour

RELEASE 1.8

vvv insert and eject iso and floppy on a running VM

WORK DONE UNTIL 1.8

vvv snapshots
   vvv snapshots on live VM (using console)
   vvv snapshots on stopped VM (using "qemu-img snapshot")
vvv every tool can display version
vvv use pid files (-pidfile)
xxx have a shrink disk feature (templates have been regenerated shrinked)
vvv upgrade bash_unit to 1.6.0
vvv bug : installation problem on debian where who command does not reply as expected
   xxx trying to reproduce > unable to reproduce in the different templates I have
   vvv figuring an other way of getting real user name
vvv commit nat feature
vvv make versions
vvv every time you use make, you reset any configuration that has been made
vvv add user in kvm group
vvv documentation of available functions and their prototypes in order to be able to develop an other backend
vvv add options to vmtemplate to list existing templates
vvv add options to vminventory to list existing groups
vvv back to GPL
vvv regularly have known_hosts issues, even if we don't check keys
vvv functions that use group / type as parameters must take them as two parameters, not as group/type form
vvv tools rationalization
    vvv vminventory + vmrunning => vminventory (when not --list as $1, outputs vmrunning) (check other ansible dynamic inventories options)
    vvv vmssh => vmssh ($0 [ -c | -m ] host|ip [cmd]) (ssh to host )
    vvv vmstop + vm + vmconsole + vmmanage => vmmanage ( $0 machine [ -g group] starts a vm and connects / $0 -s [ machine | -g group ] [-d] stops VM or group (-d destroys) -c connects to vm console / -m connects to qemu console
    vvv vmcreate + vmtemplate => vmtemplate defaults specs for all actual options (set at instantiation) ( $0 name -d | -i = creates template -d from download and -i from iso)
    vvv vminstantiate + vmrun => vmrun ($0 -f|-g [ -m specs... ] -b) ( -f starts from specfile / -r start existing group / -r -m starts specline in group / -b background)
vvv make downloadable templates with nocloud key
vvv change name
vvv make cmnet a service
xxx option to download latest iso for known distribs
vvv being able to upgrade templates in an automatic way
vvv separate vmssh in command and fonction, for the other scripts to be able to call it by function
vvv tool to ssh a VM without specifying -o
xxx automatic add in know_hosts upon instanciation
vvv bug vminventory : GROUP and TYPE are not restricting anything => and that was normal
vvv bug vmstop : stops everything (but only drops what it is asked to) => due to bug in vmrunning
vvv have an installer and don't type bin/ for each command
vvv improve doc
xxx project on github and templates on https://git-lfs.github.com/
vvv get sudo out of network conf
vvv have name resolution
vvv instantiation from file
vvv instantiation becomes a lib function
vvv create a private host network as I use in virtualbox (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/QEMU#Host-only_networking)
vvv produce a functional archlinux template
